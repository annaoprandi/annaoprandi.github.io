			<h2>High density environment </h2>
			What do we mean by <b>"high density environment"</b>?
			These regions of space are characterised by a high density of objects, as opposite to the voids defined
			by the large-scale web structure of the universe, the "cosmic web" <i>(see figure below)</i>.
<p style="text-align:center;">

	<i> Simulation of the large-scale structure of the Universe.
On the right: dark matter density (where haloes and high density environments are shown in light pink). On the left: gas
		density (where the filaments that feed gas to galaxies are highlighted) [Illustris Project] </i></p>
			</br>
			There are two types of high density environments:
			<ul>
  			<li> <b>Galaxy clusters</b>: The largest gravitationally bound structures of the universe. They
				contain thousands of galaxies and their masses are around 100000 billion solar masses.
				Virgo is the nearest galaxy cluster, located at 20 million light years from us.</li>
				<li> <b>Galaxy groups</b>: Small aggregates of galaxies that contain up to 50
				members. They have masses around 1000 billion solar masses. The Milky Way (where we are!) is located
				in a group of galaxies called the Local Group.</li>
</ul></p>
			<b>Galaxies have been observed to be less star forming (more gas-poor) in high density environments
				rather than in the "field" (isolated)</b>.
			<h2> Quenching </h2>
<p> A galaxy is defined as <b>"quenched"</b> when it has run out of all of the gas needed
				for gas formation. But how does this exactly happen?
			</p>
			<h3> Web detachment </h3>
			One theory that has been brought forward is the <b>"web detachment"</b> model: once a galaxy falls into a
			high density environment its connection with the cosmic web filaments is severed. The filaments, made
of gas and dark matter, were the galaxy's way to accrete new gas: once the connection is severed the galaxy will never accrete
gas again.
<p style="text-align:center;">

	<i> Model that represents the detachment of a galaxy from the cosmic web in a schematic way. From left to right:
the galaxy (small orange spiral) falls into a high density environment and its connection with the cosmic web (that was feeding it gas)is severed [Aragon-Calvo, 2019].
		</i></p>
			
			<h3> Environmental Quenching </h3>
			What about the gas already contained in the galaxy? 
Once the galaxy has been disconnected by its gas supply, its pre-existing gas is stripped away by
			mechanisms acting within the high density environment (and also consumed by bursts of
			star formation).
</br></br>
			These mechanisms can be divided in two categories:
</br></br>
                        <ul>
				<li> Hydrodynamical mechanisms: Ram-pressure stripping, strangulation. </li>
			        <li> Gravitational mechanisms: Harassment, tidal stripping. </li>
			</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;">

	[NASA, ESA, Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)].
	</i></p>
<p>
                        They all have
different regions of influence, but they are all effective in the innermost regions of the high density environment.
We would then expect galaxies located deep within the environment to be subject to the combined effect of all mechanisms: they
tend to be more gas-poor and therefore less star forming.
			
				<h2> How do you calculate how long it takes for a galaxy to be stripped of all of its gas?</h2>
				The focus of my research project is to build a statistical model that constrains the <b>"quenching
					time"</b>: the time it takes for the environment to completely quench a galaxy and leave it stripped of
its gas.</br></br>
				This model, built using observational data and simulations, rests on the assumption that the
quenching time entirely depends on: </br></br>
				<ul>
				<li> The initial stellar mass of a galaxy: we assume that the bigger the galaxy is, the longer
					it will take for its gas to be completely stripped</li>
				<li> The time at which the galaxy and surrounding CDM subhalo fell into the massive CDM halo associated
					with the high density environment</li>
				</ul>
                                

The input for the model are:</br></br>
<ul>
	<li> Observational data of the cluster or group of interest. The data must include mass info of galaxies AND star formation OR 
		gas content OR photometry. One of these three is needed in order to deduce star formation: we need
		to know how many galaxies are quenched or star forming!</li>
	<li> Dark matter simulation data from a suite that reproduces mass conditions of the observed environment. The data must include
		mass information and time of infall into environment for each satellite galaxy (and associated CDM halo).</li>
</ul>
