			<h1>A more in-depth look at galaxy evolution</h1>
			<p>If the infographic was not enough and you would like a more advanced read, this is for you!

			<h2>High density environment </h2>
			What do we mean by "high density environment"?
			These regions of space are characterised by a high density of objects, as opposite to the voids defined
			by the large-scale web structure of the universe (see picture blabla).
			There are two types of high density environments:
			<ol>
  			<li> Galaxy clusters: The largest gravitationally bound structures of the universe. They
				contain thousands of galaxies and their masses are around ... Virgo is the nearest galaxy cluster,
				at 16.5 Mpc and ...</li>
				<li> Galaxy groups: </li>
		</ol>
			<h2> Quenching </h2>
			<p> A galaxy is defined as "quenched" when it has run out of all of the cold gas (temperature HERE) needed
				for gas formation. But how does this exactly happen?
			</p>
			<h3> Web detachment </h3>
			One theory that has been brought forward is the "web detachment" model: once a galaxy falls into a
			high density environment
