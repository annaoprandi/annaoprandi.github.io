			<h1>A more in-depth look at galaxy evolution</h1>
			<p>If the infographic was not enough and you would like a more advanced read, this is for you!
                        </p>
			<h2>High density environment </h2>
			What do we mean by "high density environment"?
			These regions of space are characterised by a high density of objects, as opposite to the voids defined
			by the large-scale web structure of the universe (see picture blabla).
			</br>
			There are two types of high density environments:
			<ul>
  			<li> Galaxy clusters: The largest gravitationally bound structures of the universe. They
				contain thousands of galaxies and their masses are around ... Virgo is the nearest galaxy cluster,
				at 16.5 Mpc and ...</li>
				<li> Galaxy groups: </li>
		</ul>
			<h2> Quenching </h2>
			<p> A galaxy is defined as "quenched" when it has run out of all of the cold gas (temperature HERE) needed
				for gas formation. But how does this exactly happen?
			</p>
			<h3> Web detachment </h3>
			One theory that has been brought forward is the "web detachment" model: once a galaxy falls into a
			high density environment
			
			<h3> Environmental Quenching </h3>
			Once the galaxy has been disconnected by its gas supply, its pre-existing gas is stripped away by
			environmental mechanisms acting within the high density environment (and also consumed by bursts of
			star formation).
			</br>
			These mechanisms can be divided in two categories:
                        <ul>
				<li> Hydrodynamical mechanisms: ... </li>
					<li> Gravitational mechanisms: ... </li>
			</ul>
			
				<h2> How do you calculate how long it takes for a galaxy to be stripped of all of its gas?</h2>
				The focus of my research project is to build a statistical model that constrains the "quenching
				time": the time it takes for the environment to completely quench a galaxy and leave it "red
				and dead".</br>
				This model, built using observational data and simulations, rests on the assumption that the
						quenching time entirely depends on:
				<ul>
				<li> The initial stellar mass of a galaxy (M*): we assume that the bigger the galaxy, the longer
					it will take for its gas to be completely stripped</li>
				<li> The time at which the galaxy and surrounding CDM fell into the massive CDM halo associated
					with the high density environment</li>
				</ul>
